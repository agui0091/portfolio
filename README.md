# Angela Aguirre's Portfolio
# My Web Portfolio

## Project Description

This web portfolio project is centered around the theme of yoga, reflecting my passion for wellness and a previous interest in creating a portfolio. The goal was to gain the necessary skills and practice to eventually develop a more specialized portfolio aligned with my current career focus.

## Development Process

### Challenges Faced

One significant challenge I encountered was the difficulty in initiating the project. Much like many processes in my life, I require guidance to navigate and flow smoothly. To overcome this hurdle, I sought ways to streamline the coding process and discovered templates with Bootstrap. I approached my instructor to inquire if I could build upon these templates, and with a positive response, I began the development journey.

However, as I progressed, I encountered numerous challenges, leading me to practically code and customize everything to stay true to my initial design prototype.

### Lessons Learned

Throughout this development, I learned that despite my tendency to overthink and revisit decisions, I found joy in coding. The satisfaction derived from overcoming challenges and achieving milestones is truly gratifying. This experience emphasized the importance of continuous learning and practice, reinforcing the idea that mastery is achieved through consistent effort.

## Conclusion

This project allowed me to merge my interest in yoga with my coding journey. It reinforced my love for coding, highlighting the joy that comes with problem-solving and creating something meaningful. Moving forward, I recognize the need to continue studying and practicing, as coding is a journey of continuous improvement and hands-on experience.
